## BagDB ownership and local DB trials — 2026-09-17

Owner: run database experiments in gramlot-poc; move BagDB out of Bag JS into
Gramlot common code. Local library, read adapter, dataRecord/dataSelection,
dbSelect and grid integration are implemented with tests and a Python laboratory.
See [GP-020](../development/020-bagdb-laboratory.md). This supersedes older statements
that the fake and both declarations are wholly absent. Typed widget identities,
field/fieldcell, recursive model trees and remote providers remain open. Product
acceptance is separate; no release or architecture amendment is implied.

## Database adapter capabilities — discussion, 2026-09-15

The [dataRecord/dataSelection audit](../development/datarecord-dataselection-legacy-audit-2026-09-15.md)
now inventories both legacy helpers and their server contracts. Decide portable
record/collection response shapes, missing-record semantics, typed filters and
one pagination layer before implementing DbHandler endpoints. Suggested tier
membership is not an owner decision; this audit adds no runtime capabilities.

The owner requests a shared database contract exercised through dbSelect and
dataRecord with a fake adapter and SQLAlchemy/SQLite. A local SQLite copy of
test_invoice_pg contains 18 tables and 17,511 verified rows; this proves basic
data portability, not widget or application-model parity.

The [complete dbSelect parameter audit](../development/dbselect-parameters-and-adapter-capabilities-2026-09-15.md)
maps all 25 named legacy server parameters, dedicated browser options, inherited
families and extension points to common UI, database/model and host capabilities.
It records legacy caveats and proposes explicit per-capability support instead
of silently ignoring unsupported filters. The owner agrees on three tiers:
mandatory minimum, common optional capabilities and adapter-specific extensions.
Later owner clarification reserves advanced features for Genropy for commercial
and product differentiation: `auxColumns` is Genropy-only; standard search uses
prefix then containment with both case modes; custom `method` is common optional.
The remaining set membership is proposed in the audit. The API, capability names and first
implementation scope remain under discussion; no adapter implementation follows
from this audit alone.

Subsequent owner request produced the [minimal SQLite dbSelect
prototype](../examples/sqlite-dbselect/README.md): optional SQLAlchemy reader,
common select service and Python page on the copied customer data. This local
slice implements prefix search with empty-result containment fallback, both case
modes, identity lookup and limit. The fake adapter, dataRecord, custom method and
formal capability negotiation remain open. The API is experimental. A subsequent refactor adopts a registered
`dbhandler` proxy: `DbHandler` contains the common endpoint and
`SqliteDbHandler` specializes access. The generic shared dispatcher supports
allowlisted proxy endpoints; GenropyDbHandler is still pending.

## Django integration ownership — 2026-09-15

The owner moved all active Django adapter code, its tests, maintained guides and
Django/Bakery examples to the sibling `gramlot-django` repository. Consumers now
import `gramlot_django`; core no longer supplies `gramlot.contrib.django` or the
`django` extra. Generic Python pages, shared host services and browser runtime
remain here. Earlier Django ownership statements below are historical.
This is a local migration, not a publication.

> Latest release checkpoint (2026-09-12): GitHub v0.1.3 is published from
> 8c12313. Earlier statements below about unchanged main/tags and no database
> implementation are historical checkpoints; see [release status](../release.md)
> and [current context](README.md). Site/Rosetta production deployment completed under their separate v0.1.3 tags.

# Open work retained from Pages

## Presentation sites — owner direction, 2026-09-15

The three integration repository boilerplates now exist under `gramlot-org`:
`gramlot-fastapi`, `gramlot-django`, and `gramlot-genro-asgi`. They follow the
owner-selected `genro-asgi` packaging/tooling model. All remain pre-alpha
scaffolds; runtime dependency selection, host implementation and example
migration are still open. See each repository's SPECIFICATION.md.


Reorganize code, examples and tutorials so the owner can manage distinct sites
for presentations covering these scenarios:

1. FastAPI without database integration.
2. FastAPI with Genropy database integration.
3. Genro ASGI without database integration.
4. Genro ASGI with Genropy database integration.
5. Classic Genropy with Gramlot integration.
6. Genropy hosted on Genro ASGI with Gramlot integration.
7. Django with Gramlot integration (Bakery).

Inventory the existing examples, tutorial content and host integrations before
moving them. Define shared content versus host-specific setup, reproducible
startup instructions and a clear presentation entry point per scenario.
Keep Python-first Gramlot-only applications and the server-independent core.
The site/repository layout and migration have not yet been implemented.
The related transfer of the three Gramlot GitHub repositories to `gramlot-org`
is complete; see the decision register.

## Scoped autocomplete policy — proposal recorded, 2026-09-14

Owner requests recording, not implementing yet, an optional `autocomplete`
setting at page, Source branch and individual field level. Proposed resolution:
explicit field setting wins over the nearest configured ancestor branch, then
the page setting. Absence means inherit; `off` is an explicit value, not absence.
The resolved value must reach the native input inside the component, including
its Shadow DOM. Browser AutoFill and Gramlot's own option suggestions are separate.

Before implementation, settle the default, supported values and whether policy
changes should update already mounted fields. Verify nested branches, field
overrides and native attribute propagation. Safari may ignore `off` for AutoFill;
the feature must not promise to suppress its contact suggestions. No code change
is authorized by this recording request.

## Python recipe decorator — planned only, 2026-09-14

Add `@recipe` to expose Python composition methods through `pane.name(...)`,
automatically supplying the parent and sending already expanded Source to the
browser. The owner deferred implementation; see the
[bounded plan](../development/python-recipe-decorator-plan-2026-09-14.md).
Folder discovery, JS recipes and IDE migration remain separate work.

## Page object genro → gramlot — implemented locally, 2026-09-13

Owner-selected next change: rename the page object throughout runtime, examples,
documentation and site consumers. See the [implementation plan](../development/gramlot-page-object-rename-plan-2026-09-13.md).
The framework checkpoint `e2127a1` is pushed. The rename and consumer candidate
verification are complete locally; review and any later publication remain.
The owner excludes legacy handling and coexistence tests: Gramlot uses `gramlot`
and ignores `genro`; its external `genro-*` library dependencies retain their names.

## Recipe concept — minimal experiment, 2026-09-13

The owner-authorized [box experiment](../examples/recipes/README.md) compares
an imported Python function with an explicitly reactive standalone JS recipe.
Review it before selecting registry/naming/manifest contracts or migrating the
IDE. The manifesto includes actual Python source but has no generic loader yet.
No automatic Python-to-JS conversion or full dynamic equivalence is promised.

## After 0.1.3 consolidation: customer dialog

The owner requested opening a customer form in a dialog on row double-click, then
paused that work to commit/push source version 0.1.3. Investigation found no modal
dialog component or grid row-activation event implemented. No code for either was
added. Resume only when selected; reading versus editing/saving remains to settle.
The completed example has states, localities and customers linked by state.

## After the grid: legacy RelationTreeResolver — owner reminder, 2026-09-12

Once the current grid work is finished, inspect `RelationTreeResolver` in
`/Users/gporcari/Sviluppo/Genropy/genropy/gnrpy/gnr/sql/gnrsqlmodel/resolvers.py`.
The owner deferred this until after the grid. Following the completed first
states-grid experiment and the instruction to proceed, the source investigation
is now recorded in [the relation-tree audit](../development/relation-tree-resolver-legacy-2026-09-12.md).
The first lazy relation-tree RPC slice is now implemented locally and verified;
see [contract and limits](../development/relation-tree-rpc-2026-09-13.md).
Permission filtering, relationExplorer enrichment and grid configuration remain open.

## Collection-store design review — 2026-09-12

Review [the first store proposal](../development/collection-store-design-2026-09-12.md):
legacy-compatible declarations, shared ownership, typed selection results and a
bounded states-grid experiment. The owner approved a bounded experiment, now locally implemented and checked
against the real states database. Review its API and limits before expanding to
filters, editing or virtual collections. No full migration or release inclusion
is implied. See the implementation checkpoint at the end of the design.

## Page services foundation for 0.2.0 — experiment authorized, 2026-09-12

Review the [page services design and plan](../development/page-services-design-2026-09-12.md)
for the contract and execution scope. The owner has now assigned Sol to implement
P1–P5 and their verification in the existing worktree; grammar expansion is excluded.
The RPC experiment is local and uncommitted in
sibling gramlot-datarpc-poc; preserve it. The agent completed P1–P5 locally and the coordinator has implemented the newer owner
contract: SourceNode-owned busy refusal, no _concurrency, _delay, _lockScreen and
button action counts. Review the [alignment record](../development/rpc-source-node-alignment-2026-09-12.md)
before integration. Store scope remains single-process; page_id and JSON-to-Bag
conversion remain open. Hosted standalone services are deferred. This priority
precedes freezing the component grammar; it does not activate the broader backlog.

## Context menus and symbolic-date help — deferred by owner, 2026-09-11

The symbolic-date syntax menu belongs to the general menu design. The owner
explicitly deferred it until that work is addressed. A localized, dynamically
evaluated example menu and generic component attachment were discussed; no API
was approved and no context-menu runtime was implemented. Resume together with
menus, rather than adding a date-specific mechanism.

## Display formatting alpha — implemented, 2026-09-11

Scalar HTML content now supports reactive `format`, `mask`, and `locale`, named
temporal styles and a bounded LDML subset. See [scope and usage](../guides/display-formatting.md).
A bounded numeric pattern/preset formatter and precision-preserving numberTextBox
are also implemented; see [numeric formatting](../guides/number-formatting.md).
Independent datetime date/time styles, Data-node presentation
metadata precedence and an explicit local datetime carrier remain open. Existing
UTC datetime carriers display UTC; no browser-zone conversion is introduced.

## Date expressions and period links — investigation, 2026-09-11

Subsequent implementation: the owner requested a standalone parser agent and then
an opt-in dateTextBox trial. The importable parser now lives at
`gramlot-dom/date-parser`; `symbolic=True` integrates it through a separate editor
collaborator. See [usage and limitations](../guides/date-expression-parser.md).
The native-key buffer is deliberately limited to uninterrupted typing; pointer
and navigation changes reset it. Owner correction: no expression button; entry
is automatic from the buffer regex. Mobile/IME coverage remains to be verified.
The browser test verified `o` -> text -> `oggi+15` -> date, and `1 T` buffer
preservation -> `2 trimestre` -> 1 April. All 271 JS tests and four teaching
Python tests passed. Real mobile and cross-browser verification remain pending,
as does linked-period validation/commit behavior. No datetime/UTC change.

See [legacy audit](../development/date-expressions-legacy-audit-2026-09-11.md).
Legacy `period_to` links the start field to the end Data path; compact dates parse
in JavaScript and expression fallback runs in Python. The owner suggests browser
JavaScript evaluation and a leading `/` as an expression-entry switch. These
remain design discussion, with no parser implementation or finalized syntax.
The native local datetime editor decision remains definitive.

Local data logic has now undergone coordinator review and corrective work:
see [review checkpoint](../development/local-logic-review.md). The delivered
slice covers local setters, formula/controller expressions/scripts and inline
==. RPC, remote and broader scheduling remain pending; the full logical-block
plan is not complete.

## Gramlot API PoC — resumed by owner, 2026-09-11

The mandatory Gramlot-only rewrite is implemented and now authored in Python
(page.py), using framework openApiClient/openApiForm declarations. Application-local DOM, events,
input scraping and fetch have been removed. Layout, menu, form, source viewer,
response tabs/tree/grid use Source and shared components; state lives in Bags.
Text/auto HTTP response modes and envelopes were added to the framework resolver.
Integration and architecture tests cover the rewrite; all 348 DOM tests passed.

Remaining scope: nested visual object/array editors, composed schemas, external
references, parameter serialization styles and auth flows. JSON array shape is
preserved in memory but not yet a guaranteed TYTX roundtrip contract.
See [the PoC README](../examples/gramlot-api-poc/README.md).

## Simple component guide — immediate owner priority, 2026-09-10

Delivered as [the English HTML handbook](../guides/component-development.html),
with twelve chapters, embedded Gramlot branding and a downloadable example archive.
Source: component-guide-content.md; renderer: scripts/build_component_guide.py.
Native lifecycle/events and mounted reactive integration were checked; the HTML
was reviewed at narrow and desktop widths. Recipient-specific naming was removed.

Before logical-block implementation, prepare a component development guide:
native Web Component first, then its Gramlot integration, as one progressive
guide. The owner refined the deliverable to a professional English HTML handbook
of approximately twelve pages with Gramlot branding and no recipient-specific
names. Use a runnable example and distinguish verified integration
from the proposed manifest/discovery pipeline. The guide also serves to assess
whether the component architecture is understandable. No external delivery
or framework implementation is implied by this documentation request.

The owner-requested [logical blocks plan](../development/logical-blocks-plan.md)
orders data preparation, local providers, RPC, optional FastAPI services and
remote Source composition. It records open choices and acceptance checks;
planning does not approve proposed signatures or start implementation.

Owner requested sequencing this logical-block step before layout implementation.
The plan now groups it into reviewable local Data, expression/provider, server
call and remote-content deliveries. Use existing containers for remote tests;
do not pull new layout work into this prerequisite.

## Data providers and endpoint integration — investigation, 2026-09-10

The owner requested a legacy/current comparison for data, dataController,
dataFormula, dataRpc and remote, including page-defined Python methods versus
host-independent endpoints. The [design audit](../development/data-services-design-audit.md)
records execution rules, current gaps and a proposed optional page-method
registration convention for FastAPI. No endpoint API or implementation scope
has been approved. Keep Data results, lazy Data resolvers and remote Source
composition distinct; page-method convenience need not imply persistent mutable
server page instances.

## Connect and topics — recovered checkpoint, 2026-09-10

The owner requested recovery of the legacy's precise connect/publish/subscribe
rules before component and container design loses them. See the
[source audit](../development/events-legacy-audit.md): direct widget/DOM
connections, page/node/form topics, callback scope and subscription ownership
are distinct. Current page-local topics provide only partial coverage. Preserve
this design input; implementation and exact compatibility APIs remain deferred.

The subsequent core/adapter split is explicitly provisional and requires later
owner confirmation: declared component events and owned, scoped topics in core;
historical syntax, naming and arbitrary method interception in the legacy
adapter. The audit records the full proposal. Do not treat it as an approved
API contract or implementation authorization.

## Deferred toolbar and authorization ideas — owner checkpoint, 2026-09-10

The owner explicitly requires retaining FramePane as a widget in the target
architecture: a partly preassembled border container, not merely a historical
implementation detail. Preserve the distinction between the general
borderContainer and the convenient frame composition with accessible regions
and shared layout behavior. Legacy FramePane's distribution of rounded corners
is confirmed by the owner as the intended historical mechanism. Exact new API
and implementation scheduling remain open; this requirement does not authorize
implementing all container features immediately.

The owner supports a toolbar based on ordinary ordered children, sensible spacing
defaults and optional named groups for extension/reuse. Toolbar implementation is
deferred. A later compatibility wrapper should be evaluated for existing legacy
slotBar/slotToolbar recipes, including callbacks, prefixed options and slot
replacement, not only parsing the slots string. No replacement API is finalized.

Branch authorization is also deferred. The discussed Python callback receives
all node attributes and the page instance (which provides avatar/user context)
and returns whether to include the branch. Naming, registration and exact
exclusion semantics remain ideas. Legacy tags expressions belong in a possible
compatibility wrapper, not a required new core syntax. Do not implement this
callback or treat browser-side visibility as server authorization.

For borderContainer, the owner clarified that closable implies drawer capability
and that panel sizes can be bound to a data path in both directions: data changes
move the splitter; dragging updates the stored dimension. Legacy regions/Bag
hooks are recorded in the drawer audit. Preserve these as container requirements;
current Gramlot local splitter styling does not establish that synchronization.

Nested container corners are another owner-supplied destination requirement:
when an inner container touches an enclosing rounded edge, its presentation
should adapt without repeated recipe declarations. Consider each touching corner,
border/padding offsets, nested layout regions and reactive changes. CSS radius
is not inherited automatically; clipping children and adapting their own border
geometry are different mechanisms. Avoid blanket overflow clipping that would
cut drawer openers or other intentional protrusions. This is architectural
context, not authorization for an immediate rounded-corner implementation.

The immediate container investigation is legacy borderContainer drawers, with
tabContainer also identified as a priority. See
[drawer source audit](../development/drawer-legacy-audit.md). This checkpoint
authorizes investigation, not an unsolicited container rewrite.

Updated: 2026-09-08. These entries preserve discussion; they are not an automatic first-version roadmap. A historical issue link identifies provenance, not its current remote status.

## Questions requiring design work

| Topic | What is still open | What must not be assumed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOT | Meaning and boundaries of Live Object Tree | LOT is not yet a renamed SourceBag class or a formal synchronization protocol |
| Builder data ownership | Page-owned/borrowed Bag, stable observation root, subbuilders, seeding, disposal; `data` versus `store` naming | No final global rename, and no requirement for generic Builders to depend on Pages |
| Page loader and endpoints | Plain recipe classes; mixin versus composition; endpoint discovery; access to services; separate lifetimes | The old illustrative `PortableGui`, `AsgiGui` and endpoint decorators do not exist merely because they appear in prose |
| Portable packaging | A FastAPI-friendly install, optional host services, resource discovery and JS inclusion | The current source-override demo is not a verified installed Gramlot package |
| Stores | Legacy store families, identity, row projection, access/update APIs, local/remote loading, views, paging and cleanup | Do not port Dojo wholesale or conflate collection stores with form persistence adapters |
| Local duplicate validation | A collection-identity-aware `localnodup` contract after the store study | A virtual cache cannot guarantee remote uniqueness; `nodup` retains database meaning |
| Grouplets | Definition versus instance; data, method and callback isolation; local versus remote recipes; optional form ownership | Isolating `datapath` alone does not prevent shared-mixin method collisions |
| Remote validation | Service/RPC adapter, typed results, transport errors, stale responses, save barriers | The supplied-function validation hook is not a complete legacy server validator |
| Numeric widgets | Typed parsing, scale, readonly formatting, display versus representability | Formatting is not validation and must not silently round valid model data |
| Asset delivery | ESM build strategy, CSS/JS requirements, optional collections, caching, installed resources | Vite/esbuild/bundling and separate JS publication remain choices, not all approved requirements |
| Routing/page identity | Stable routing class, store access by page id, resolver path, concurrency and auth | Do not invent cached per-page instances, lock guarantees or mutable remote mixins |
| Data synchronization | Selective subtrees, initial value/baseline, server business checks, concurrent changes, save barriers | No full source/data mirroring or production replay guarantee is implemented by the prototype |
| Iframe transport | Root WebSocket, logical page identities, validated parent/child routing and disposal | Do not open one physical socket per iframe as an unexamined fallback |
| Large collections/grids | Window over server selection, bounded client data, scrolling and identity | No complete new grid is available; do not make one a prerequisite for existing demos |
| Server panels | Composable monitor/users/tags/tasks/inspect/orchestration/plugins panels | Inventory is not an implemented GUI; the monitor POC needs live in-memory telemetry, not unrequested durable persistence |
| Legacy coexistence | Optional legacy DB, mixed old/new application resources and package/v2 conventions | The initial standalone ASGI/FastAPI use must not be blocked on hybrid legacy hosting |
| Mobile/accessibility | Real pointer/touch checks, handles, scrolling, zoom, cancellation and keyboard behavior | Automated desktop emulation is not complete device validation |

## GramlotBuilder preparation — 2026-09-09

The [approved architectural basis](gramlot-builder.md) supersedes a generic Builders rename as the default approach. Before implementation, verify public-wheel extension hooks and browser-only execution, resolve node.data versus datastore access, specify Source transport identity and settle the loader entry boundary. SVG embedding needs a conformance check; a standalone SVG builder is not required yet.

Builders #43 now evaluates ownership/removal of all three generic data-elements. Earlier summaries describing it solely as a completed formula rename are historical.

## Specific continuity details

The forms task explicitly requested a substantial legacy-store study. Inventory both `GnrStoreBag/Grid/Query` and `gnr.stores._Collection` families (`BagRows`, `ValuesBagRows`, `AttributesBagRows`, `Selection`, `VirtualSelection`, `RpcBase`, `FileSystem`). Inspect `_identifier`/`identifier`, label, application key, node identity, filtered views and partial loading separately. This is preserved in the historical roadmap and forms conversation; it is not implemented here.

The grouplet review identified two independent collision risks: IDs in repeated recipes and methods mixed into the shared page object. Legacy immediate construction and resource-qualified remote lookup mitigate some cases but are not a general isolation guarantee. Panel/wizard/grid/chunk forms remain research. The wizard analysis noted that advancing after calling save without awaiting completion merits a future behavioral check.

The old manual recorded a `storeTree` retained-callback diagnostic after disposal. That observation belongs to its earlier snapshot; verify the selected DOM commit before treating the defect as present, fixed or newly introduced by migration.

## Historical dependency and issue references

- Builders: [#37](https://github.com/genropy/genro-builders/issues/37) stable root, [#41](https://github.com/genropy/genro-builders/issues/41) SourceBag, [#42](https://github.com/genropy/genro-builders/issues/42) GUI data spelling, [#43](https://github.com/genropy/genro-builders/issues/43) `formula` alignment. The last is reported implemented in the selected preview line; refresh actual status before further work.
- DOM: [#1](https://github.com/genropy/genro-dom-js/issues/1) runtime consolidation. The old six-commit handoff is not the complete selected `d888cef` delta.
- ASGI: [#72](https://github.com/genropy/genro-asgi/issues/72) opaque payload forwarding across commander/UDS/worker. This was parked separately from GUI naming and Builders work.
- The tested preview pins Python Bag 0.21.1, TYTX 0.15.0 and older ASGI compatibility; Bag 0.22/ASGI incompatibility was a historical finding, not a live registry lookup in this import. Refresh before upgrades.
- Bag JS `faf6bef3badb389d25ea4cb3b35c5369cb7ffd8a`, TYTX `6b9bf3a486014d92812caa3b06674083e646c5cd` and Builders `25ae61950717afae10e1d43d8318f272122202ac` belong to the recorded preview. Source overrides must not hide a changed dependency baseline.

The historical `runtime-contract`, `page-owned-runtime`, `python-page-bootstrap` and `registered-page-startup` workflows were completed and archived. They are retained as evidence, not active Gramlot workflows. Earlier prompts requesting agents, messages or releases belong to those tasks and do not authorize repeating them now.

## Verified extension gaps — 2026-09-09

[GramlotBuilder probes](gramlot-builder-verification.md) identified inherited data-element signature replacement as a generic blocker. Hard-coded root/expansion Source construction requires an extension hook only if specialized Source types are selected; a minimal authoring facade already resolves nested data without replacing generic nodes. Python/JS XS transport passed in isolation; full facade conformance and JS HTML/SVG grammar switching remain explicit follow-ups. Parent-driven construction passed without changing ownership; the constructor has no parent argument. No preview dependency was removed.

The [legacy remote/service inventory](legacy-data-remote-services.md) separates RPC, lazy Data, remote Source and optional database helpers. The [contract draft](gramlot-builder.md#contract-draft-01--parent-data-and-service-boundaries) records parent semantics and both data alternatives without selecting one prematurely.

## Continue in Gramlot — verified checkpoint

[Transition handoff](transition-to-gramlot.md): 106 Python/integration and 212 DOM tests pass with explicit preview Builders provenance. Continue framework work here now. First establish a reproducible Gramlot-local environment, then implement the bounded builder slice; publication and historical directory removal remain blocked on their own checks.

## Rosetta consumer update — 2026-09-09

Local migration to Gramlot is implemented in the existing demo-rosetta checkout; see workspace-map.md and its docs/GRAMLOT-MIGRATION.md. FastAPI source consumption is verified without genro-asgi. This resolves the local consumer migration work, not host-optional wheel packaging, repository renaming or removal of Builders preview.

## GramlotBuilder implemented — superseding preview gate

The first facade/transport slice now works with public Builders 0.23.2; see gramlot-builder.md. Gramlot has its own .venv and a clean-wheel installation check. Rosetta consumes that wheel and public Builders. Earlier preview requirements are historical for these migrated consumers. Generic removal under #43, controller naming, remote and broader composition remain separate work.

## Server independence — owner decision, 2026-09-09

Gramlot must not depend on Genro ASGI, including through an optional extra. A future separate application repository will combine Gramlot and Genro ASGI for business applications. This supersedes earlier suggestions for gramlot[asgi] or an optional in-package host adapter.

The integration has been extracted from the Python package and browser assets: application/routes, worker, server configuration, host-specific startup document, WSX/RPC client and bootstrap. Exact originals and associated host tests are preserved under docs/history/asgi-extraction-20260909 with a SHA-256 manifest, excluded from wheels and source distributions. They are recovery material for the future repository, not an active integration maintained inside Gramlot.

Gramlot retains the builder, typed transport, browser runtime, widgets, inspector, recipes and host-independent tests. The CLI only serves local HTML documentation via the Python standard library; it no longer launches an application server. Rosetta owns its FastAPI integration and now installs the Gramlot wheel normally, without --no-deps. No server framework is required by Gramlot.

## Rosetta comparison candidate — 2026-09-11

The owner suggested adding NiceGUI to Rosetta. Record it as a candidate, not an
instruction to modify the separate application immediately. Compare the same
progressive examples using idiomatic implementations, with particular attention
to transfer of learning and shared concepts. Measure production JS/CSS/assets on
cold load and during interactions; keep development editors out of both totals.
NiceGUI is relevant to Python authoring and has a backend-first architecture
(FastAPI, Vue/Quasar and Socket.IO), so distinguish browser-local work from
server-mediated interactions. No NiceGUI integration has been started.

## DRY review and action/menu components — owner priority, 2026-09-11

Separate owner-selected teaching example: lesson `11-source-slider` demonstrates
a JavaScript controller inserting/removing contact-card Source nodes while keeping
their Data. The shared field function uses relative paths under stable example
paths `contacts.c1`, etc.; these paths do not define a store identity contract.
The owner explicitly defers RPC-driven repetition, `_identifier` and stores until
after this slider example. Removing Source must not delete Data. Owner correction:
the example must be Python-authored and shown read-only. `recipe.py` now uses the
existing HTML `script` tag to declare browser functions called by the button and
controller. Its iframe follows content height, including the embedded inspector.
The earlier JavaScript-only editable version is superseded.

Owner clarification in the resumed conversation: this review should identify the
architecture of Gramlot Components around reusable base classes and mixins,
maximizing shared implementation. The owner explicitly assigns the assessment
to a Sol agent, with coordinator review. Validation and `lbl_*`/`box_*`
decoration are candidate shared capabilities; no particular mixin API or class
hierarchy has been approved. Assess how mixins connect components to existing
services rather than duplicating those services. The immediate deliverable is
an architecture proposal grounded in current code, not a framework refactor.

Assessment delivered: [Gramlot browser component architecture review](../development/gramlot-components-architecture-review-2026-09-11.md).
Sol prepared the proposal and the coordinator reviewed the responsibility and
lifecycle boundaries. Base/mixin names, the field adapter, and the first migration
slice remain proposals; no runtime refactor or new test run accompanied the review.

Subsequent owner correction: include `dateTextBox` and `dateTimeTextBox` as the
guiding cases for the architecture slice; color picker is not the selected pilot.
The owner also includes `numberTextBox`, explicitly covering decimal places and
formatting. Assess shared typed-editor capabilities while keeping stored values,
editing, display formatting and validation distinct; verify legacy semantics
before proposing attribute names or rounding behavior.
Later clarification: use GenroPy legacy as the documentation and comparison
reference for all reviewed components, but formal compatibility with its confusing
numeric/date formatting vocabulary is not required. Propose clearer formatting
conventions where useful; see the formatting exception in the decision register.
The existing date/time inputs and the missing date-time component require a
legacy-contract check before selecting a shared base or a single/composite control
shape. The assessment's first-slice section has been updated accordingly.

Before expanding the framework much further, critically assess actual code reuse:
shared responsibilities must have one implementation rather than being copied
between widgets. Review input/binding/decoration/validation and provider lifecycle
boundaries; distinguish necessary component-specific behavior from duplicated
infrastructure. Avoid speculative abstractions that add complexity without actual
shared responsibility. This review is a prerequisite to substantial expansion.

The owner requests adding or completing buttons, dropdown buttons, menus and
context menus as soon as practical. First inventory existing implementations and
legacy contracts, then identify shared menu/action behavior and the missing pieces.
Preserve prior event/topic and layout decisions; this request does not approve
unrelated toolbar, authorization or container redesign. No implementation or
background work started at this checkpoint.


## Tutorial validation presentation follow-up — 2026-09-11

While adding lessons 23–24, browser checks observed a nonempty validation error
message and `data-invalid` on the host while its inner input had
`aria-invalid="false"` after blur (numeric max rule; also email before explicitly
setting email_iswarning=False). Audit competing field-state/blur presenters.
The tutorial tests verify visible messages and correction recovery; they do not
claim this accessibility-state discrepancy is fixed.

## Reusable CI-built browser distribution — 2026-09-11

Design Gramlot's versioned, distributable browser runtime artifact built by its
own CI. Consumers should reuse it across pages instead of each rebuilding the
framework. Define entry points, shared chunks, lazy resources, manifest, notices
and release verification; decide packaging/wheel delivery separately. Rosetta and
site bundling are transitional implementations. See the corresponding owner
decision in decisions.md. No new framework release has been published for this.

Concrete packaging proposal: [CI-built browser distribution](../development/browser-distribution-proposal.md).
It separates the approved distribution objective from the proposed zip/wheel
layout, manifest fields, delivery policy and release gates.

Implementation update: ZIP/wheel payload parity and the optional FastAPI adapter
are implemented and locally verified; see the proposal's local checkpoint.
Framework publication and consumer migration to that artifact remain pending.
The floating inspector defect found during packaging is corrected: recipe
compilation now checks SourceBag typing, and reconciliation preserves externally
attached stores. Browser checks verified populated Data/Source trees, editing and
close/reopen in both source and bundled modes. See the checkpoint for evidence.


## Data RPC consolidation checkpoint — 2026-09-12

Use [consolidated Data RPC contract](../development/data-rpc-consolidated-contract-2026-09-12.md) before resuming server work.
The next bounded action is integration review of the existing page-services/RPC
worktree, preserving its local presentation changes. Do not reopen superseded
_concurrency proposals. Remaining API questions are listed in that contract.

RPC result-contract correction: legacy `mode='bag'` transports a rich envelope,
including `(value, resultAttrs)` / BagNode results and separate client Data changes.
Explicitly design result-node metadata before calling the value-only experiment
complete. See the final section of the consolidated Data RPC contract. This is
separate from JSON-to-Bag conversion and does not imply restoring XML transport.

When specifying RPC result metadata, preserve the recorded distinction between
resultattrs, request diagnostic headers and envelope side channels. Decide their
Gramlot representation explicitly; do not silently add all diagnostics to Data
node attributes or assume TYTX auto-typing implements the legacy result protocol.

## Database-coherent selectors — legacy investigation

See [legacy dbSelect contract](../development/dbselect-legacy-contract-2026-09-12.md).
The owner asks to recover its strong database coherence: relation-aware authoring,
identity resolution versus search, row versus result attributes, invalid current
values, selected_* propagation and table-change cache invalidation. This is evidence
for design, not authorization to couple Gramlot core to a database implementation.


## 0.1.2 RPC integration — superseding worktree-only status

The owner includes Data RPC in 0.1.2. Runtime, tests and usage documentation are
now integrated into the canonical develop checkout as uncommitted changes. The
worktree remains preserved. Next is review/commit/branch integration at the release
gate, not repeating the file integration. Resultattrs and other open contracts are
still listed explicitly; no tag, main update or publication has occurred.


Commit checkpoint: RPC and examples are recorded in develop commit ef23584.
The owner authorizes commit and branch push, explicitly without release. Earlier
instructions to prepare the implementation commit are now satisfied. main and
version tags remain unchanged; release policy and resultattrs work remain open.

## First database integration: GnrApp under FastAPI

The owner proposes GnrApp('test_invoice_pg').db for the first specialized page.
See [the source investigation](../development/gnrapp-db-fastapi-investigation-2026-09-12.md).
Preserve same-worker context/query/cleanup, explicit transaction ownership and
conversion from legacy Bag to Gramlot Bag. Legacy page notifications are not
provided by plain GnrApp. No live DB connection or implementation was performed.

## Public Rosetta pointer interactions after v0.1.3 deployment

Local and release CI passed 50/50 browser tests, but public verification passed
48/50. Inspector internal splitter drag and builder Source-tree hover actions
are intermittent (focused repeat: 3/6 passed). Investigate layout readiness and
pointer targeting before attributing the cause to application or test code.
Production health, lesson interactions and the site customer dbSelect passed.
See [release checkpoint](../release.md) for deployed tags, CI runs and digests.

## Remote Source compatibility investigation — 2026-09-13

Owner requested detailed legacy analysis before remote construction experiments.
See [remote Source audit](../development/remote-source-legacy-audit-2026-09-13.md)
for verified source behavior, differences from the current prototype, failure
risks and the proposed acceptance matrix. No remote policy change approved yet.

## Grouplet-driven remote priorities — 2026-09-13

The owner wants grouplets soon. The [focused legacy audit](../development/grouplet-remote-legacy-2026-09-13.md)
traces the actual Grouplet → remoteBuilder → gr_loadGrouplet pipeline and the
separate GroupletForm lifecycle. Start with resource/instance isolation, Data
scope, guarded remote loading and post-install readiness. Full legacy variants
remain out of the first slice; this is a proposal, not a completed port.

## Before closing remote: all store integration levels — 2026-09-13

Required by the owner: assess resident, RPC, DB selection, paged, filesystem,
widget adapters and form-store families, plus their interaction with lazy Bags.
Check ownership, scoped registration, load/save, replacement, teardown and
multiple grouplet instances. Use the [integration checklist](../development/remote-store-integration-checklist-2026-09-13.md).
The review does not imply implementing every legacy store before the first grouplet.

## All legacy store families — owner scope expansion, 2026-09-13

The owner now authorizes the broader store port plus FileSystemTree. The earlier
review-only limit is superseded. See [implementation matrix and remaining work](../development/store-port-2026-09-13.md).
Local entry points exist for selection/paged/filesystem collections and the form
store families; the full virtual, persistence/navigation and remote/grouplet
contracts remain incomplete. Do not describe the full migration as finished.
