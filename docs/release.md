# Gramlot release status

## Current source version: 0.1.5 — unpublished

Assigned on 2026-09-13 after the page-object rename. Python and internal
JavaScript package versions are aligned, including the npm lockfile.

Breaking authoring change: application code uses `gramlot` instead of `genro`;
function callbacks receive `args.gramlot`. There is no compatibility alias.
Regenerate previously serialized Source and migrate authored controller/action
strings. External `genro-*` library names remain unchanged. See the
[migration outcome](development/gramlot-page-object-rename-plan-2026-09-13.md).

This assigns a source version only. The latest published framework release
remains v0.1.3; no tag, package publication or deployment accompanies this bump.
Gramlot remains pre-alpha; 0.2.0 beta is the development target. Framework and
site version numbers are independent, even when both use 0.1.5.

## Previous source version: 0.1.4 — unpublished

The owner assigned 0.1.4 on 2026-09-13 after the relation-tree consolidation
(commit `8be2f7a`). Python and internal JavaScript package versions are aligned.
This is a local source version: no push, tag or publication is authorized by
this version change. The latest published framework release remains v0.1.3.
Gramlot remains pre-alpha; 0.2.0 beta is the development target.

## Published GitHub prerelease: 0.1.3

Published on 2026-09-12 from tag `v0.1.3`, commit `8c12313`.
[GitHub assets](https://github.com/genropy/gramlot/releases/tag/v0.1.3) include
wheel, sdist, browser ZIP and checksums. The release workflow completed all CI
gates. The release is explicitly pre-alpha; no PyPI, npm or CDN upload was made.
The previous PyPI release remains 0.1.0a1.

Local full Python verification: 152 passed. Browser ZIP/wheel parity: 46
identical files. Consumer site/Rosetta migration and deployment are separate.

The source-version checkpoints below describe earlier authorization stages.

## Site 0.1.5: complete PostgreSQL demo through Genropy

The separate site tag `v0.1.5` (commit `5054e94`) was deployed successfully:
[release CI](https://github.com/genropy/gramlot-site/actions/runs/34718597461).
Framework remains `v0.1.3`; Rosetta remains `v0.1.3` with the public verification
limits recorded below. This site checkpoint supersedes the earlier SQLite demo.

The owner confirmed the invoice data is fictional and requested the complete
application database, PostgreSQL and installed Genropy. A native dump of all
18 physical `invc` tables was transferred over SSH and restored into a dedicated
PostgreSQL 17 service. The snapshot contains 17,511 rows, including 3,200 customers,
800 localities, 1,695 products, 256 invoices and 806 invoice rows. Notes, yearly
prices and remaining lookup tables are included. Administrative data is excluded
except referenced identity keys required by the staff relation. The model's
`product_group` table does not exist in the source database and was not fabricated.
The original database is untouched; this is a snapshot, not live replication.

The site installs Genropy from public revision
`418b4454a6e08445817e858a1b5d2a2c91c2dbf5`, with matching models and a checksummed
wheel. FastAPI mounts `GnrApp` through `gramlot.contrib.fastapi_genropy`;
both database pages inherit `GenropyPage` and query through
`self.db.table(...).query(...).fetch()`. Application database access is SELECT-only.
The raw dump remains on the database host, outside GitHub and the site image.
CI uses separate minimal fixtures.

Production verification through `GnrApp` passed all 18 table counts and foreign-key
checks. Both public browser scenarios passed: [linked state grids](https://www.gramlot.org/database/states/)
and [customer lookup](https://www.gramlot.org/database/customer-select/), including
state switching, reload and complete Python source display. Customer lookup
returns up to ten suggestions per search; that is not the database size.

## Earlier consumer production deployment: 2026-09-12

The owner explicitly authorized workflow/environment changes and production.
Both consumers now verify ordinary main pushes without publishing; validated
version tags reachable from main trigger publication and deployment. Production
environments accept v* tags only, with no untagged manual deployment bypass.

- Site application tag v0.1.3: commit `4121590`,
  [successful CI/deploy](https://github.com/genropy/gramlot-site/actions/runs/34714614611).
  Image digest: `sha256:f79dbc08e592bb247c003066cbccc89981e322bd64f11183ebcc54a7f6818d55`.
- Rosetta application tag v0.1.3: commit `93cd1da`,
  [successful CI/deploy](https://github.com/genropy/gramlot-rosetta/actions/runs/34714618801).
  Image digest: `sha256:6fe64122d9c4ce3dcc29f6e4c13f2d514ca6faa8975f16cdf6fe7abf9a6da375`.

At this checkpoint, both public health endpoints reported the same released wheel SHA256:
`893b9a75a10437f239739b70f635a602dac24864e68b0c1de4deea2cc80dfae2`.
Both hosts use FastAPI. The initial public customer dbSelect demo used synthetic SQLite
fixtures; no local legacy customer data was copied to production. Production
images remain private; host deployment retains the previous digest for rollback.
Framework, site and Rosetta tags are distinct releases; none was moved.

Post-deployment verification: public site homepage, Python tutorial and synthetic
customer dbSelect browser scenario passed. Public Rosetta passed 48/50 browser
checks; the inspector splitter drag and builder Source-tree hover checks failed.
A focused three-repeat run passed 3/6, confirming intermittent behavior rather
than a clean public pass. Both had passed local and tag CI runs. These two
pointer/layout interactions remain open; do not report all public tests green.

## Previous source checkpoint: 0.1.3

The owner assigned **0.1.3** on 2026-09-12 and authorized commit and push to
`develop`, without a tag or publication. Python and internal JavaScript metadata
are aligned; browser manifests derive the version when rebuilt. Gramlot remains
pre-alpha; 0.2.0 beta remains the next development target.

This checkpoint includes the shared resident/RPC stores, optional
`gramlot.contrib.fastapi_genropy`, the common FastAPI example host and the live
states → localities/customers example. The customer double-click dialog was
requested but paused before implementation when the owner chose consolidation.
The previous Data RPC foundation is already recorded in ef23584/bef2f15.

The states and customer queries were verified against local PostgreSQL, with
browser checks for state-driven detail loading. Broader collection features and
the general RPC resultattrs protocol remain open. Source version assignment and
branch push do not constitute a release. Previously built artifacts retain their
original versions; no earlier artifact is renamed.

The sections below retain earlier 0.1.2 verification and publication history.

## 0.1.2 scope update — 2026-09-12

The owner explicitly includes the Data RPC foundation in 0.1.2, rather than
reserving it for 0.2.0. The experimental changes have been integrated into the
canonical checkout as uncommitted work on develop, with source version 0.1.2.
main has not yet been advanced. This is a local release candidate, not publication.

Included: @endpoint/@source and MRO discovery, TYTX page services, browser readiness
before main, SourceNode-owned busy refusal, _delay, boolean _lockScreen, the shared
server-call service and triangle example. The associated bounded contentPane
remote and process-local store infrastructure are carried with this foundation.
Existing example presentation changes are preserved.

The legacy `(result, resultattrs)` protocol is not yet implemented explicitly;
JSON-to-Bag conversion, reusable Page instances and page_id remain open. Do not
claim full dbSelect or legacy RPC compatibility. See the
[consolidated contract](development/data-rpc-consolidated-contract-2026-09-12.md).
Before tagging, review the final diff, align publication policy, and verify the
actual release commit and artifacts. This scope update authorizes no registry,
CDN or GitHub publication.

## Published release: 0.1.0a1

**0.1.0a1**, first alpha, published on PyPI on 2026-09-09.

The tag-triggered workflow passed CI and uploaded the wheel and source archive.
A fresh environment installed `gramlot[fastapi]==0.1.0a1` from PyPI successfully.

- [PyPI release](https://pypi.org/project/gramlot/0.1.0a1/)
- [Publishing run](https://github.com/genropy/gramlot/actions/runs/34339515923)

Read the Docs is active: [English manual](https://gramlot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The first successful build (34468533) published commit a924e2b.

The candidate includes Python authoring, typed Source transport, browser runtime,
widgets, inspector APIs, optional FastAPI integration and an English Sphinx manual.
The FastAPI extra is optional; core installation does not load a server framework.

## Local validation

- 83 core Python/integration tests pass without the FastAPI extra.
- 9 FastAPI adapter tests pass in an environment with its optional dependencies.
- 212 browser runtime unit tests pass.
- Sphinx HTML builds with warnings treated as errors.
- Wheel and source archive pass strict Twine validation.
- The wheel is built from the source archive, then installed and verified in
  an isolated environment without optional server dependencies.
- Installed adapter browser navigation and discovery were verified locally.

## Build

```sh
npm --prefix js/dom ci --ignore-scripts
python scripts/prepare_assets.py
python scripts/build_browser_distribution.py
python -m pip install build twine
python -m build
python -m twine check --strict dist/*
```

The browser build emits a content-addressed ZIP and embeds the identical payload
under `gramlot/resources/browser/` in the wheel. Its manifest inventories public
ES-module entries, lazy inspector resources, licenses, hashes, sizes and media
types. `scripts/verify_browser_distribution.py` checks ZIP/wheel byte parity.
The build hook checks every browser asset against the prepared manifest, and the
installed wheel requires no Node tooling. Browser ZIPs and checksums are uploaded
as a separate CI artifact, so Twine and PyPI only receive Python distributions.
The alpha filename has been rebuilt during development: identify local candidates
by hash or browser build ID, not version alone.

## Automation and service setup

See [publishing instructions](development/publishing.md) for CI, Read the Docs
and the PyPI Trusted Publisher fields. Publishing requires an authenticated
account on the external services; configuration files alone are insufficient.

## Local integrated RPC candidate verification — 2026-09-12

Canonical develop, source 0.1.2, uncommitted integration:

- Full Python suite: 142 passed, 3 dependency deprecation warnings. The first
  sandboxed run had one localhost-server failure and four skips; the complete
  run with localhost permissions passed with no skips.
- Full DOM JavaScript suite: 365 passed. Previously recorded jsdom
  requestAnimationFrame diagnostics still appear; passing assertions do not
  establish that these diagnostics are resolved.
- Chromium: 3 passed against the integrated checkout's bundle on localhost:8068,
  covering startup, local/Python parity, remote Source, busy refusal and layout.
- Browser candidate: gramlot-browser-0.1.2-fd9a953c6325fc51.zip, 45 payload files.
  No fresh wheel parity or clean-install check is claimed for this build.
- git diff --check passed. All 37 inventoried incoming worktree files remain
  byte-identical to their pre-integration copies. Backups and the integration
  inventory are in /private/tmp/gramlot-rpc-integration-012.

main remains 07bf835; no v0.1.2 tag was created. This record is local verification,
not CI completion or publication. The final release gate is still required.


Documentation validation before commit: Sphinx HTML build passed with warnings
as errors (`-W --keep-going`). The remote preflight found no develop branch;
branch push creates it without changing main or sending tags.

## 0.1.3 consolidation checks — 2026-09-12

- Runtime regression: 370 JavaScript tests passed.
- Python regression before the final customer example extension: 147 passed,
  four skipped, three dependency deprecation warnings. Nine focused contrib/example
  tests passed again after that extension, including RPC method registration,
  empty selections and parameterized detail queries.
- Live PostgreSQL/Chromium: states, localities and customer grids; NSW/VIC detail
  filtering, state selection retained on reload, uniform live/source presentation.
- Source version 0.1.3: wheel and sdist built successfully with existing local
  build dependencies (`python -m build --no-isolation`); Sphinx warnings-as-errors
  build passed. These local artifacts are not published releases.
- Customer modal form is deliberately excluded: investigation only, no partial
  dialog implementation. No changes to consumer repositories.
