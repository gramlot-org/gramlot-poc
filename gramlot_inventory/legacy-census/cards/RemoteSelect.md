# RemoteSelect

## Identity

- **Identity:** `RemoteSelect`
- **Type:** component
- **Level:** LOW-LEVEL
- **Purpose:** source-backed census entry; detailed product purpose is taken from the declarations below.
- **Status:** implementato; corrispondenza di portata da verificare

## Bases, mixins and composition

Declared by `GenroWidgets`.
Declaring-class bases: none or module-level declaration.
No literal child/delegation target is present in the primary Python bodies.

## Common parameters

### `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/widgets/genro.py::GenroWidgets::RemoteSelect:L110`

| Parameter | Type | Presence | Default | Bindings | Constraints / consumer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `**kwargs` | not declared | open extension boundary | empty mapping | Arbitrary names may include bindings; the boundary is open. | No parameter docstring in the primary declaration. |

`**kwargs` is not a closed parameter set. The declaration forwards or interprets additional names; user-defined callbacks, prefixed attributes and downstream widget/server consumers can extend it. Only statically discoverable names are listed above.

## Behavior, output and errors

- `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/widgets/genro.py::GenroWidgets::RemoteSelect:L110`: Select widget that fetches options from a remote method. Args: **kwargs: Remote method configuration and standard select attrs.
- Runtime output, precedence, ignored parameters and raised errors require following the implementation consumers; absence here is recorded as unresolved rather than inferred.

## Primary Python implementation evidence

### `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/widgets/genro.py::GenroWidgets::RemoteSelect:L110`

```python
def RemoteSelect(self, **kwargs):
        """Select widget that fetches options from a remote method.

        Args:
            **kwargs: Remote method configuration and standard select attrs.
        """
        ...
```


## Abstract extension hooks

Statically visible extension families: none in the primary declaration bodies.
Open `**kwargs`, callbacks and dynamically selected handlers remain extension boundaries and cannot be finitely enumerated from signatures alone.

## Generic example

```python
# Legacy discovery example; availability in Gramlot depends on Status.
root.RemoteSelect(...)
```

## Code and evidence

- `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/widgets/genro.py::GenroWidgets::RemoteSelect:L110`
- Name appears in a literal legacy namespace registration list or child/tag construction.
- Current Gramlot name-level evidence: `js/dom/src/components/builtin-components.json`, `src/gramlot/grammar/inputs.py:L29`, `src/gramlot/grammar/logic.py:L96`.

## Incompatibilità Genropy legacy

A current Gramlot declaration with the same case-insensitive name was found; complete parameter and runtime compatibility is **da verificare**.
