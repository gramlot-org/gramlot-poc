# footer_item

## Identity

- **Identity:** `footer_item`
- **Type:** component/helper
- **Level:** COMPOSED
- **Purpose:** source-backed census entry; detailed product purpose is taken from the declarations below.
- **Status:** da implementare

## Bases, mixins and composition

Declared by `GnrDomSrc_dojo_11`.
Declaring-class bases: `GnrDomSrc`
Direct construction/delegation targets found in the Python bodies: `item`.

## Common parameters

### `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/gnrwebstruct/dojo11.py::GnrDomSrc_dojo_11::footer_item:L560`

| Parameter | Type | Presence | Default | Bindings | Constraints / consumer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `field` | not declared | optional | `None` | Legacy Source binding syntax may be accepted; exact consumer must be followed. | No parameter docstring in the primary declaration. |
| `**kwargs` | not declared | open extension boundary | empty mapping | Arbitrary names may include bindings; the boundary is open. | No parameter docstring in the primary declaration. |

- **Forwarded keyword names:** `field`

`**kwargs` is not a closed parameter set. The declaration forwards or interprets additional names; user-defined callbacks, prefixed attributes and downstream widget/server consumers can extend it. Only statically discoverable names are listed above.

## Behavior, output and errors

- `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/gnrwebstruct/dojo11.py::GnrDomSrc_dojo_11::footer_item:L560`: No behavior docstring is present in the primary declaration.
- Runtime output, precedence, ignored parameters and raised errors require following the implementation consumers; absence here is recorded as unresolved rather than inferred.

## Primary Python implementation evidence

### `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/gnrwebstruct/dojo11.py::GnrDomSrc_dojo_11::footer_item:L560`

```python
def footer_item(self,field=None,**kwargs):
        return self.child('item',field=field,**kwargs)
```


## Abstract extension hooks

Statically visible extension families: none in the primary declaration bodies.
Open `**kwargs`, callbacks and dynamically selected handlers remain extension boundaries and cannot be finitely enumerated from signatures alone.

## Generic example

```python
# Legacy discovery example; availability in Gramlot depends on Status.
root.footer_item(...)
```

## Code and evidence

- `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/gnrwebstruct/dojo11.py::GnrDomSrc_dojo_11::footer_item:L560`

## Incompatibilità Genropy legacy

No current Gramlot declaration with the same case-insensitive name was found. Status: **da implementare**. Detailed runtime comparison is **da verificare**.
