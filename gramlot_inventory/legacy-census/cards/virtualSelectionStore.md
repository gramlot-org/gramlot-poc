# virtualSelectionStore

## Identity

- **Identity:** `virtualSelectionStore`
- **Type:** controller
- **Level:** LOW-LEVEL
- **Purpose:** source-backed census entry; detailed product purpose is taken from the declarations below.
- **Status:** da implementare

## Bases, mixins and composition

Declared by `GnrDomSrc_dojo_11`.
Declaring-class bases: `GnrDomSrc`
No literal child/delegation target is present in the primary Python bodies.

## Common parameters

### `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/gnrwebstruct/dojo11.py::GnrDomSrc_dojo_11::virtualSelectionStore:L168`

| Parameter | Type | Presence | Default | Bindings | Constraints / consumer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `table` | not declared | optional | `None` | Legacy Source binding syntax may be accepted; exact consumer must be followed. | the :ref:`database table <table>` name on which the query will be executed, |
| `storeCode` | not declared | optional | `None` | Legacy Source binding syntax may be accepted; exact consumer must be followed. | TODO |
| `storepath` | not declared | optional | `None` | Legacy Source binding syntax may be accepted; exact consumer must be followed. | TODO |
| `columns` | not declared | optional | `None` | Legacy Source binding syntax may be accepted; exact consumer must be followed. | it represents the :ref:`columns` to be returned by the "SELECT" |
| `**kwargs` | not declared | open extension boundary | empty mapping | Arbitrary names may include bindings; the boundary is open. | No parameter docstring in the primary declaration. |

- **Forwarded keyword names:** `columns`, `storeCode`, `storepath`, `table`

`**kwargs` is not a closed parameter set. The declaration forwards or interprets additional names; user-defined callbacks, prefixed attributes and downstream widget/server consumers can extend it. Only statically discoverable names are listed above.

## Behavior, output and errors

- `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/gnrwebstruct/dojo11.py::GnrDomSrc_dojo_11::virtualSelectionStore:L168`: TODO :param table: the :ref:`database table <table>` name on which the query will be executed, in the form ``packageName.tableName`` (packageName is the name of the :ref:`package <packages>` to which the table belongs to) :param storeCode: TODO :param storepath: TODO :param columns: it represents the :ref:`columns` to be returned by the "SELECT" clause in the traditional sql query. For more information, check the :ref:`sql_columns` section
- Runtime output, precedence, ignored parameters and raised errors require following the implementation consumers; absence here is recorded as unresolved rather than inferred.

## Primary Python implementation evidence

### `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/gnrwebstruct/dojo11.py::GnrDomSrc_dojo_11::virtualSelectionStore:L168`

```python
def virtualSelectionStore(self, table=None, storeCode=None, storepath=None, columns=None, **kwargs):
        """TODO
        
        :param table: the :ref:`database table <table>` name on which the query will be executed,
                      in the form ``packageName.tableName`` (packageName is the name of the
                      :ref:`package <packages>` to which the table belongs to)
        :param storeCode: TODO
        :param storepath: TODO
        :param columns: it represents the :ref:`columns` to be returned by the "SELECT"
                        clause in the traditional sql query. For more information, check the
                        :ref:`sql_columns` section
        """
        self.selectionStore(storeCode=storeCode,table=table, storepath=storepath,columns=columns,**kwargs)
```


## Abstract extension hooks

Statically visible extension families: none in the primary declaration bodies.
Open `**kwargs`, callbacks and dynamically selected handlers remain extension boundaries and cannot be finitely enumerated from signatures alone.

## Generic example

```python
# Legacy discovery example; availability in Gramlot depends on Status.
root.virtualSelectionStore(...)
```

## Code and evidence

- `genropy/gnrpy/gnr/web/gnrwebstruct/dojo11.py::GnrDomSrc_dojo_11::virtualSelectionStore:L168`

## Incompatibilità Genropy legacy

No current Gramlot declaration with the same case-insensitive name was found. Status: **da implementare**. Detailed runtime comparison is **da verificare**.
